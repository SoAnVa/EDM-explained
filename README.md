# Exploring the Paper: "Elucidating the Design Space of Diffusion-Based Generative Models"

This interactive notebook provides a structured exploration of the paper [**Elucidating the Design Space of Diffusion-Based Generative Models**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00364). The aim is to provide a clear, hands-on understanding of the core concepts and choices in the design of diffusion-based generative models, particularly focusing on the trade-offs and mechanisms behind deterministic and stochastic sampling.

## Overview

The notebook is organized to mirror the structure of the original paper while offering an interactive and dynamic exploration of each key section. You can experiment with the various concepts, methods, and algorithms discussed in the paper and see the practical effects of different design choices in real-time.

### Structure of the Notebook

The notebook is divided into the following sections:

1. **Introduction**  
   A brief introduction to the problem of diffusion-based generative models and a summary of the paper's contributions.

2. **A Refresher on the Diffusion Models**  
   This section provides a theoretical overview of diffusion models, revisiting key concepts and laying the groundwork for the subsequent sections.

3. **Sampling Choices**  
   - **Source of Errors**: Discusses the main sources of errors during sampling and the trade-offs between different sampling techniques.
   - **Select the Design Choices**: Outlines the key design choices when setting up diffusion models.
   - **Elucidating Deterministic Sampling**: Focuses on deterministic approaches to sampling, highlighting key mechanisms and techniques.
   - **Elucidating Stochastic Sampling**: Explains stochastic sampling and its implications for model performance.

4. **The Neural Denoiser, aka Score Function**  
   Delves into the core of diffusion modelsâ€”the neural denoiser or score function. This section explains how the neural network interacts with the sampling process and contributes to the generative capabilities of the model.

5. **Network and Preconditioning**  
   Explores how the network is structured and preconditioned for optimal performance within diffusion-based generative frameworks.

6. **Training and Loss**  
   A detailed look at the training procedures and loss functions employed to train diffusion models effectively.

7. **Conclusion**  
   Summarizes the key takeaways from the paper and the hands-on exploration of diffusion-based models.
